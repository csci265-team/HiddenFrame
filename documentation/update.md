 ## 1. Phase 1 Summary of Changes

 ### 1.1. Charter
 N/A

 ### 1.2. Proposal
 N/A

 ## 2. Phase 2 Summary of Changes
 
 ### 2.1. Requirements

 Per Prof. Wessels' observation, the mathematics section of the original requirements document contained little detail of the methods intended to be used in the backend of encoding or decoding messages.  This has been updated to include definitions of a group, a cyclic group, a generator and a description of the Euclidean Algorithm. A description has been included to show how these concepts will prove helpful for the encoding and decoding of bitstrings for this particular project.

 ### 2.2. Standards
 N/A

 ## Phase 3 Summary of Changes

 - Git standards: A new staging branch was added and a bunch of git standards were updated based on feedback.

 ### 3.1. Requirements

 - Use cases and scenarios were updated in order to meet our new view on the project, specifically Chapters 5.1.2, 5.2.2, 5.2.3.
 - The new web page "Profile Page" has been added. The information about it may be found in Chapter 4, specifically 4.4.

 ## Phase 4 Summary of Changes
 
 ### 4.1 Standards

 -  The team has added an extra clause to our existing merging rule to the staging branch stating "If a PR has not met the merge criteria for over 48 hours the git lead or organizational lead may review and merge it overriding the prior rule" due to pull requests taking too much time to merge into the staging branch.

 ### 4.2 Requirements

 - Users will use a username as an identifier, not an email address.
 - Set a default time for Image Retention as shown in Section 6.1.
 - Set a default upload size and maximum resolution as shown in Section 6.1.
 - Removal of "how many invites a user can send to others to join the secret user's list" and "whether we will use a private user's username or email address as identifying information" from Section 2. Known issues/omissions under "Other known ommisions".
 - Removal of embedded images having a slightly different design/animation due to api requests taking too long making it unviable to load all payloads initially with image loads.
 - Addition of Administrative User Actions for administrative users to Section 2. Known issues/omissions, to be worked on during the next phase.

 ### 4.3 Design 

 - Significant changes have been made to section 6.2 Routes, removing uneccesary routes, adding headers, fixing request bodies, and adding descriptive text to explain each request. 
 - Addition of routes Administrative Users will be using was added in Section 1. Known Ommisions, to be worked on during the next phase.

 ## Phase 5 Summary of Changes

 - William Thornley has left our team, so now we don't have a review lead. Instead every member of a team is responsible for reviewing equally.

 ### 5.1 Requirements
 Updated the maximum allowed image filesize to be 10MB and not more than $2^{31}$ pixels.

 Updated compute times on keys to be less than 5 seconds with an average time of less than 3 seconds.

 Updated requirements to specify that keys should be psudo-unique and have less than a 1 in 500,000 chance of producing the same key given the same image and message combination.

 Updated the secontion title 6.3 Mathematics to 6.3 Key Generation

 Updated to include team decision regarding revoking access to remove all child invitees of the removed user.
